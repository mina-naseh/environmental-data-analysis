# Environmental Data Analysis Project

This project involves the analysis of air quality data from Kraków, focusing on pollutants such as CO, NOx, PM10, and PM2.5. The goal is to explore trends, seasonal patterns, and correlations between different pollutants using time series analysis techniques.

## Key Analysis Steps
- **Data Cleaning**: The raw datasets were cleaned, with missing values handled and the data resampled for consistency.
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Applied seasonal decomposition to isolate trends, seasonality, and residual noise in the pollutant data.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examined relationships between pollutants within Kraków air quality stations.
- **Visualization**: Generated plots to visualize the histograms, time series and correlation results for better insights.

This analysis helps in understanding pollution patterns and their sources, providing valuable insights for environmental monitoring.
